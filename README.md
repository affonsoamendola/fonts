Fofonso's Fonts

Hello!

Here are a bunch of fonts I've been making for a while, if you like them, please use them!

They are all in GIMP xcf format so you can edit and mess around with them all you want.

All of them are very pixelated (And pixel-perfect!, no aliasing here!), since they were made for me to use in my games, 
and almost all of them use oldschool graphics..

If you do decide to use them, please add a little credit to me in the credits or something like that,
no problems if you dont, but it would be very excellent!
